Welcome! My name is Manuel Paccagnella, and I'm your host for this blog. I was born in 1986 and now, a bunch of years later, I work in Italy as a software developer in a small company that creates software solutions for local businesses.

In my day job I work mainly with Java and Javascript, but I have a great passion and curiosity for the world of software development and Iâ€™m constantly learning. I've a particular interest in *functional programming*, and right now I'm particularly fond of [Clojure](http://clojure.org/). If you attended [EuroClojure 2012](http://euroclojure.com/2012/) you have probably saw me there :)

I like to read, study, [write some code](https://github.com/manuelp) and occasionally post in this blog.
